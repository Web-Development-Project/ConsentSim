# ConsentSim

## Overview
Our website is designed to teach you about consent and its many aspects - including how to identify it, some ways to ask for it and how to proceed. This is a very important topic, as it will apply to everyone at some stage in their life; not only in sexual contexts but also in general friendships and relationships with other people. The goal of this website is to explain everything in a straight-forward and clear way so that there is little confusion on the subject for all users. We hope that everyone who visits our website learns something that they can carry into their real life!

## Design and Development
### Design
Many different aspects were considered when initially trying to come up with a design for the website. The website is intended for teenagers and older, so based on that and the important content matter we wanted to make the website serious, yet not boring. 
The design of the website was intended to be gender-neutral so that it is applicable and relatable to anyone who wishes to use it. This is displayed through the language used, colours, and general appearance. 

### Development
An agile methodology was used in the development of this project, as it was more suited to both the website itself and the collaborative nature of its development. This way, team members could work on different parts independently then come together at various stages to fit everything together 
1. Planning was done so that team members were all on the same page and knew what the objectives of the webpage were. This included:
   * Goals and objectives
   * Time scheduling
   * Division of workload
2. Ideas and potential designs of the project
   * Initial sketches and layout of the page
   * Potential content
   * Including the coding/functionality of the page to compliment the content and message
3. Prototying and construction
   * Team members worked on allocated parts of the webpage
   * At periodic time intervals the team had meetings to judge progress, reallocate work, and implement new ideas
   * New versions of the project were prototyped and updated
   * Attempts to validate pages
4. Release
   * Final version of the webpage released
